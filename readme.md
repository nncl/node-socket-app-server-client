# Node Socket App

With **Server** and **App** working separately. 

Just training from [here](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client).

Feel free to copy, paste and distribute it **for free**.

## Getting Started

Go to your terminal, enter this repo directory and run:

```
npm install
```

After that, run in a tab the server:

```
node server.js
```

And then, the app:

```
node app.js
```

Now, just access **http://localhost:3000**.

Made and learnt with love :)
